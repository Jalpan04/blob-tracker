# Pixelmess: The Glitch Art Workstation <img src="logo.png" height="40" align="bottom"/>

**Pixelmess** is a real-time visual performance tool that turns your webcam or video files into reactive, high-energy glitch art. Designed for creative coders, VJs, and content creators, it breaks free from static filters with a "drag-and-drop" interface for instant cyberpunk visuals.

## Key Features

*   **Live & Offline**: Jam live with your webcam or batch-process video clips for high-quality production.
*   **Dynamic Tracking**: Automatically detects motion to apply effects only where it matters—on the action.
*   **Retro-Future Aesthetic**: Built-in "Win2K", "CRT", "Thermal", and "Dither" effects.
*   **Smart Export**: Render 60FPS MP4s with a single click, ready for social media.
*   **Shape-Aware Labels**: Intelligent labeling system that adapts to both circular and rectangular tracking regions.
